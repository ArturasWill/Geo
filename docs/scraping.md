# Web scraping approach

## Overview
This is how we've approached web scraping so far, using Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Playwright) or external services (AgentQL, Octoparse). Each tool is suited for different scales and complexities. We encourage participants to take this document for inspiration, experiment with their own methods, and share ideas on which parts could be improved.

## Approach with Python libraries

### BeautifulSoup
- **Purpose:** Simple HTML parsing for smaller or well-structured sites.  
- **Key features:** Easy to learn, minimal setup required.  
- **Limitations:** Slower for large-scale tasks, no built-in async, manual updates for site changes.  

### Scrapy
- **Purpose:** Large-scale scraping with high-speed async requests.  
- **Key features:** Proxy and middleware support, handles complex tasks well.  
- **Limitations:** Requires coding and configuration, steeper learning curve.  

### Selenium
- **Purpose:** Automates a real browser to handle JavaScript-heavy pages.  
- **Key features:** Can click buttons, fill forms, simulate real user actions.  
- **Limitations:** Slower than pure HTTP-based scrapers, needs browser drivers.  

### Playwright
- **Purpose:** Modern browser automation, faster alternative to Selenium.  
- **Key features:** Headless mode, multiple browser contexts, good for JS-heavy sites.  
- **Limitations:** Still heavier than direct HTTP libraries, needs more setup.

## Comparison: BeautifulSoup vs Scrapy

| Feature          | BeautifulSoup          | Scrapy                   |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Scale           | Small to medium        | Large-scale, complex     |
| Speed           | Sequential (slower)    | Asynchronous (faster)    |
| Ease of use     | Easy setup, fewer deps | More coding and config   |
| Anti-scraping   | Limited (manual setup) | Built-in proxy/middleware |
| Output options  | CSV, JSON              | CSV, JSON, DB integration |

## Comparison: Selenium vs Playwright

| Feature         | Selenium                              | Playwright                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Browser control | Requires drivers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) | Built-in drivers, multiple browser contexts |
| Speed          | Slower for heavy tasks              | Generally faster                          |
| JS handling    | Full real-browser automation       | Same, with improved performance           |
| Ease of setup  | Well-known, large community        | Newer but simpler parallel usage          |
| Use case       | Form fills, dynamic sites         | Similar, but can handle concurrency better |

## Approach with AgentQL and Octoparse

### AgentQL
- **Purpose:** AI-powered scraper using natural-language queries.  
- **Key features:** Minimal manual element selection, flexible API.  
- **Limitations:** Free plan rate-limited, requires data validation (due to potential AI hallucinations).  

### Octoparse
- **Purpose:** Visual scraper for smaller tasks with easy database export.  
- **Key features:** Cloud-based, direct CSV output, no heavy coding needed.  
- **Limitations:** Subscription-based, limited concurrent runs, not ideal for highly dynamic sites.

## Handling anti-scraping

- User-agent rotation  
- Delays & randomization  
- Browser automation (Selenium/Playwright)  
- Proxies & IP rotation  
- Captcha solving  

---

## Scraping workflow

1. Select websites  
2. Choose tool (library or external service)  
3. Configure scraper (set parsing rules or workflows)  
4. Run & monitor (check for site changes or errors)  
5. Handle anti-scraping (user-agents, proxies)  
6. Clean & validate (ensure structured, correct data)  
7. Store/export data (CSV, JSON, DB)  

---

## Output formats

- **CSV:** Octoparse by default, or any Python library  
- **JSON:** AgentQL, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Playwright  
- **Database:** Octoparse supports auto-export, Scrapy can be configured, etc.  

**Example of news article in JSON:**
```json
{
  "title": "Sample Title",
  "author": "Jane Doe",
  "date": "2025-02-04",
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "content": "Article text...",
  "tags": ["Tech", "AI"]
}
```

## Main challenges

- **Handling dynamic websites:** Some sites use heavy JavaScript, making standard HTTP-based scrapers less effective. Tools like Selenium (or Playwright) can help but are slower.  
- **Anti-scraping measures:** Captchas, rate limits, and bot detection can block or slow scraping.  
- **Scalability:** Tool limits and middleware optimizations can affect concurrency.  
- **Data accuracy & consistency:** Ongoing validation keeps data structured and error-free.  
- **Website structure changes:** Layout updates may break scrapers, requiring frequent maintenance.

## Conclusion

By combining different tools (e.g., Octoparse, AgentQL, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium) and using proxy/IP rotation, you can balance automation, flexibility, and scalability. Choosing the right tool for each task helps streamline data extraction while reducing effort.
