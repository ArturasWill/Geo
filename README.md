# Project Documentation
This document outlines the data collection and processing strategies we’ve been using or experimenting with so far. It serves as both a recommendation and inspiration for exploring your own approaches.

We invite hackathon participants to comment, critique, and suggest improvements over the hackathon. Feedback can be shared in the document, we can hold discussions on Discord, and during calls.

We’ll refine each point, tracking what worked and what didn’t. By the end of the hackathon, we aim to create a comprehensive guide on the best tools, methods, and approaches for getting high-quality content into the knowledge graph, along with their effectiveness ranking.
